# 🏠 House-Sales-in-King-County-USA

This project explores housing data to predict property prices using machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression and Ridge Regression, including polynomial feature transformations.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes of houses such as:
- Square footage (`sqft_living`, `sqft_above`, `sqft_basement`)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location attributes like `lat` and `waterfront`
- House features like `floors`, `grade`, `view`, and more

## 🔧 Methods Used
- Data Cleaning (dropping unnecessary columns)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression with R² calculation
- Ridge Regression with regularization (`alpha=0.1`)
- Polynomial feature transformation (2nd order)

## 📈 Tools and Libraries
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
